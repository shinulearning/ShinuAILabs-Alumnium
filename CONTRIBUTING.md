# Contributing to Alumnium

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Alumnium!

Alumnium is an experimental AI-powered test automation solution that aims to simplify test interactions and assertions. Your contributions can help improve this project.

## Project Understanding

Before contributing, please review:

- Our [README][1] and [documentation][2] help you understand Alumnium's vision of creating higher-level abstractions for test automation that simplify web page interactions and strengthen assertion mechanisms.
- Our experimental status—we're in early development and value innovative approaches.
- The core functionality that uses natural language processing to interpret testing commands.

## Monorepo Structure

Alumnium is organized as a monorepo with two main packages:

- **`packages/typescript/`** - Core TypeScript implementation, MCP, and AI servers
- **`packages/python/`** - Python client implementation

Both packages share the same API and can be developed independently or together.

## Finding Your Contribution Opportunity

- Explore the [open issues][3] to find tasks matching your interests
- We will be glad if you help us with:
  - Improving test coverage for edge cases.
  - Enhancing documentation and examples.
  - Exploring more natural language prompts for test generation.
  - Reporting usability issues or unexpected test behavior.
  - Creating sample projects using Alumnium.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup

First, clone the repo:

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alumnium.git
cd alumnium
```

Then install [mise] (see the [mise documentation][mise-install] for more installation instructions):

```bash
# Universal
curl https://mise.run | sh

# Homebrew
brew install mise
```

Finally, install dependencies for the project:

```bash
mise install
```

### 2. Configure AI Provider Access

Configure access to AI providers as mentioned in [docs][4].

### 3. Development Guidelines

When working on Alumnium:

- Follow the existing code style and patterns in each package.
- Ensure compatibility with Appium, Playwright, and Selenium.
- Document new functionality with clear examples.
- Test your changes thoroughly in the relevant package.

#### Python Development

```bash
cd packages/python

# Quick testing with REPL
uv run python -i demo.py

# Run BDD system tests
TEST_ONLY=behave mise :test/system

# Run pytest system tests
TEST_ONLY=pytest mise :test/system

# Run all system tests
mise :test/system

# Run system tests with specific driver
mise :test/system:selenium
mise :test/system:playwright
mise :test/system:appium-ios
mise :test/system:appium-android

```

#### TypeScript Development

```bash
cd packages/typescript

# Run system tests
mise :test/system

# Run system tests with specific driver
mise :test/system:selenium
mise :test/system:playwright
mise :test/system:appium-ios
mise :test/system:appium-android

mise :test/system:maestro-android

# Run unit tests
mise :test/unit

# Format code
mise :format

# Check types

```

#### Monorepo Commands

From the root directory, you can use `mise` commands:

```bash
# Run system tests for all packages
mise :test/system

# Run unit tests for all packages
mise :test/unit

# Format code for all packages
mise :format

# Check types for all packages
mise :types
```

### 4. Environment Variables

For local development, you may need to configure the following environment variables:

| Variable Name        | Description                                                                                              | Default Value             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `ALUMNIUM_DRIVER`    | Driver to use for tests (selenium, playwright, appium-ios, appium-android, maestro-ios, maestro-android) | `selenium`                |
| `ALUMNIUM_MODEL`     | AI model provider (anthropic, openai, google, etc.)                                                      | `openai`                  |
| `ALUMNIUM_LOG_PATH`  | Path to the alumnium log directory                                                                       | `stdout(logs to console)` |
| `ALUMNIUM_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level or configuration value                                                                         | `WARNING`                 |
| `ALUMNIUM_CACHE`     | Cache provider or disable it                                                                             | `filesystem`              |

### 5. Pull Request Process

1. **Create a focused branch** for your contribution.
2. **Write meaningful commit messages** explaining your changes. We use the [Conventional Commits][5] format.
3. **Include tests** that verify your contribution works as expected.
4. **Update documentation** if you're adding or changing features.
5. **Maintain API parity** - If adding features to one package, consider implementing them in both Python and TypeScript.
6. **Submit your PR** with a clear description of what it accomplishes.

### 6. Continuous Integration

Every pull request runs build, formatting, lint, type and unit checks. System tests and agent
evaluations also run automatically for pull requests opened from branches in this repository,
using the `azure_openai` provider only. Pull requests from forks do not receive API keys, so
their system tests are skipped until a maintainer runs them explicitly (see below).

Maintainers can run the full suite manually from the _Actions_ tab or with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Run system tests for a fork pull request after reviewing its changes
gh workflow run ci.yml -f pr=123

# Run against specific providers and clients (every provider, driver and client is a checkbox input)
gh workflow run ci.yml -f google=true -f anthropic=true -f typescript=false -f java=false -f selenium=false -f eval=false
```

Only `azure_openai` is checked by default. Every provider from `packages/typescript/src/Model.ts` is
available, but only some have credentials configured in CI (azure_openai, anthropic, aws_anthropic,
aws_meta, deepseek, google, mistralai, openai); the others will fail until secrets are added.

## AI-First Testing Philosophy

As contributors to an AI-powered testing tool, we value:

- **Natural language over rigid syntax**: Tests should be readable by non-technical stakeholders.
- **Adaptability over brittleness**: Tests should withstand UI changes.
- **Intent over implementation**: Focus on what should happen, not how it happens.
- **Context awareness**: Testing tools should understand the application under test.

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. See the [Code of Conduct][6] for more details.
- Share knowledge generously—we're all learning in this emerging field.
- Value diverse perspectives—they lead to more robust solutions.
- Ask questions when unclear—clarity benefits everyone.

## For First-Time Contributors

If you're new to open-source or AI-powered testing:

1. Try running the demo and experimenting with the Alumnium API. Use the REPL (`poetry run python -i demo.py`) to explore functionality.
2. Start with documentation improvements or simple bug fixes. Check out the [**good first issue**][7] label.
3. Ask questions on GitHub, [Discord][8] or [Slack][9].
4. Found a security issue? Please follow our [Security Policy][10] instead of opening a public issue.

## Recognition

All contributors will be acknowledged in our releases and documentation. As an experimental project on the cutting edge of testing technology, your contributions here represent pioneering work in the field.
