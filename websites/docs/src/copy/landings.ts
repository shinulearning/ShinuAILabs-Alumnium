                Alumnium is a suite of libraries and tools for natural-language end-to-end testing of web and mobile applications. It consists of:

                - MCP server for agentic testing;
                - client libraries for writing tests in Java, Python, and TypeScript;
                - test runner for executing Markdown scenarios locally or in CI; and
                - server for central model communication and caching.

              question: "Which test frameworks does Alumnium support?",

              answer: md`
                Alumnium works with:

                1. Selenium or Playwright for web automation.
                2. Appium or WebdriverIO for iOS and Android mobile testing.
                3. Maestro for iOS and Android mobile testing through the MCP server.

                Client libraries let you add Alumnium incrementally alongside
                existing framework code. Exact capabilities vary by framework
                and platform, so check the documentation for current support.

              question: "Do I need an AI API key?",

              answer: md`
                Alumnium makes its own requests to the model provider,
                so you generally need a valid API key or other credentials
                for the provider you choose. You can also run a supported
                model locally through Ollama, which does not require an API key.
                If you have ChatGPT subscriptions, you can use the Codex
                support to reuse your ChatGPT subscription in Alumnium

                See the [configuration guide](/docs/getting-started/configuration/)
                for the current provider matrix and setup instructions.

            en: {
              question: "What data does Alumnium send to AI providers?",

              answer: md`
                When you use a hosted model, Alumnium sends the relevant
                natural-language instruction and UI context to that provider.
                Screenshots may also be sent when a vision-enabled operation
                needs them.

                Use a supported local model through Ollama when model inference
                must stay on infrastructure you control. OpenTelemetry tracing is
                optional and exports only to the endpoint you configure.

                Choose the entry point that matches your workflow:

                1. Agent: add the Alumnium MCP server.
                2. Existing test suite: install the Java, Python, or TypeScript
                   client and initialize it with Selenium, Playwright, or Appium.
                3. Markdown tests: use the test runner.

              answer: md`
                Yes. Alumnium provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for
                compatible clients including Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor.
                An agent can use it to drive and verify browser or mobile
                applications, and engineers can build custom agents on the same
                high-level MCP tools.

              answer: md`
                Alumnium is under active development and is currently used to
                power thousands of tests in production by early adopters.
                Start with non-critical test flows, review AI-generated scenarios,
                and expand usage as you validate it in your environment.
